3. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
GET requests data from a specified source. POST submits data to be processed to a specified resource. POST requests are more secure because they are never cached and do not remain in the browser history. A GET request should not be used for passwords or other sensitive information.

4. Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
Cookies are text files stored on computers by browsers. Cookies are created by websites visited by a user. Cookies are used to remember information about a visitor when they return to a site, such as a username or shopping cart information.
