Woo! jQuery!

I already know a little bit of jQuery from Codecademy and a Railsbridge workshop, but it has been a while and I'm pretty rusty. So I have an ok grasp of what jQuery *can* do, but it'll take some time to get familiar with the syntax and documentation again.

- pizza maker
  - click on a button to add various topping to an image of plain cheese pizza
  - click through to menu subcategories (crust, meat, veggie, sauce)
    - non-selected options should gray out; sub options should appear underneath
  - options added should be listed in an order receipt (table) at the bottom of the page

I'll start out with the Udacity jQuery course.

When I'm learning something, it usually helps for me to have a project that I can test things out with.

I'll block out some simple HTML and CSS to get me started.

Steps for the project:
- block out basic HTML structure of the menu and receipt
- create CSS blocks for menu items and the table
- hide elements responding to click events
- figure out how to bundle two actions into one click event (e.g. clicking "pepperoni" affects the button AND adds pepperoni to the receipt table)
- learn how to make things return to their previous state after being clicked
