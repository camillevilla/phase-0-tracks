1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
Input:
SELECT * FROM students
Output:
1|Astrud|4|1
2|Joao|3|3
3|Nimrod|2|2
4|Quito|5|1
5|Esperanza|2|3

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
Input:
UPDATE students SET grade=5 WHERE name="Astrud";

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
Input:
SELECT * FROM students, teachers WHERE students.teacher_id = teachers.id;
Output:
1|Astrud|5|1|1|Mr. Camargo
2|Joao|3|3|3|Ms. Gilberto
3|Nimrod|2|2|2|Ms. Smith
4|Quito|5|1|1|Mr. Camargo
5|Esperanza|2|3|3|Ms. Gilberto

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
Input:
SELECT students.name, teachers.name FROM students JOIN teachers on students.teacher_id = teachers.id;
Output:
Astrud|Mr. Camargo
Joao|Ms. Gilberto
Nimrod|Ms. Smith
Quito|Mr. Camargo
Esperanza|Ms. Gilberto
