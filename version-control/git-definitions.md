**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control software allows us to to track changes to files over time. 
Git keeps track of different authors modifications to the project and allows us to go back in time and check out earlier versions of the project. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the project. You can work on new features without disturbing the original code. Later, changes can be reviewed and the branch can be merged with the original project. This allows colleagues to simultaneously work on different parts of the same project. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is an update to the file, accompanied by a unique identifier, a timestamp, and the commit author's name and contact information. A good commit message should be short but meaningful.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict arises when two people make different edits to the same section of the file. When a merge conflict is identified, Git offers comparisons from the conflict branches and prevents the user from merging until the conflict is resolved.
