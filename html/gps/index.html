<!-- 

1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? 
HTML semantic tags are useful for grouping the information on the page, as well as helping us organizing how sections of content relate to each other.

2. Which ones do you see as most useful?
Section and article are the most useful for me, because section allows us to chunk information that is directly related, while article allows to connect other content.

3. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The browser will first convert all of the html elements to nodes. Then it will order them, and finally style them. 

4. hat did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? 
I learned how to use snippets, and the necessary tags for setting up and saving my own.

5. Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Yes, one that I think could be extremely useful would be smaller but common snippets like tables or navs, as well as possibly stylesheets.

6. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
Once concept that was difficult was ordering some of the elements within the body of our page. Some elements, like "main" and "aside" we'd never used before. So reading up on those best practices, including using the flow doc from Canvas, will be helpful.
